# FlightCrewSupportMobileApp
Contains source code for an Ionic Framework mobile web app to allow flight crew to perform fuel checks and read METAR weather reports. The provided files are not sufficient to rebuild the app.

The METAR report reading function requires an API key which I have not provided, but the API is public and can be found here. Much thanks to Michael for his work on the API and the free access.
